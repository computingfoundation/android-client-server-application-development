# Enterprise-android-application-development

**Enterprise-android-application-development** is a full-stack Java Android and backend framework for developing full-stack enterprise Android applications quickly. It has multiple features that will cut a year (but probably two) off of your full stack application development.

It consists of three components:

* Backend application (Java)
* Android application (Java)
* Core library (Java)

* Remote user messages
    * Change user messages that are displayed on the opening of a screen or the click of a button or almost any event by changing configuration records in the database (full framework within the app to implement remote message for any event).


# Release

Update: May 2021: This project is not fully finished but all I have to do is clean up the source code. This repository currently contains only some of the source code. The full source code will be uploaded in the fall.
